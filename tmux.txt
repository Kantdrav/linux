In tmux, you can split your screen into multiple panes (terminals) — either horizontally or vertically — and view them side-by-side or stacked.

Here’s how to view two terminals in tmux:
✅ 1. Split the tmux window horizontally

(one pane on top, one at bottom)

Ctrl + b, then "

(That’s: hold Ctrl, press b, then release both and press the double quote " key.)
✅ 2. Split the tmux window vertically

(one pane on the left, one on the right)

Ctrl + b, then %

(Press Ctrl + b, release, then press the percent sign %.)
🔄 Switch between panes

Use:

Ctrl + b, then arrow keys

(e.g., →, ←, ↑, ↓ to move between panes)
🔄 Resize panes (optional)

Press:

Ctrl + b, then hold Ctrl and press arrow keys

Some setups require:

Ctrl + b, then :resize-pane -D   # down
Ctrl + b, then :resize-pane -U   # up
Ctrl + b, then :resize-pane -L   # left
Ctrl + b, then :resize-pane -R   # right

❌ Close a pane

In a pane, simply type:

exit

Or press Ctrl + d.

Let me know if you want to view more than two terminals, create named sessions, or save a default layout.
