To solve the problem described in the README.md, you need to create a shell script script.sh that does two things:

    Displays the differences between file1.txt and file2.txt in a unified format.

    Prints the names that are common to both files.

Hereâ€™s how you can write script.sh:

#!/bin/bash

# Display the differences in a unified format
diff -u /opt/assets/file1.txt /opt/assets/file2.txt

# Print the names that are common to both files
comm -12 <(sort /opt/assets/file1.txt) <(sort /opt/assets/file2.txt)

Explanation:

    diff -u: Shows the difference between files in unified format.

    comm -12: Shows only the lines common to both files.

        comm requires sorted input, so we use <(sort file) to sort both files before comparison.

Steps to make it executable:

chmod +x script.sh

Now you can run it using:

./script.sh

Let me know if you want to redirect the output to a file or add error handling.
